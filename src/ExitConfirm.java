 * If the user clicks "No", a static method from the Main class is used to bring the user to the menu.  This method 
 * also has a nested inner class.  MouseAdapter is used to see where the user has clicked.  A try catch block is used
 * to trap in case the image cannot be read in.  An if statement is used to determine where the user has clicked.
