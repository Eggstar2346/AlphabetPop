  * The Splashscreen2 class is a JPanel that shows a cute opening
  * screen when the user first opens the game. It starts out with
  * bubbles spelling the word "Alphabet Pop", which then disperse
  * randomly. The bubbles then pop in order to spell out "Alphabet Pop"
  * at the top of the screen before moving to the main menu screen.
  *
  * <p>
  * <b>Instance variables: </b>
  * <p>
  * <b>splash</b> A BufferedImage variable that refers to the background image used in the splashscreen.
  * <p>
  * <b>title</b> A String variable that contains the word "Alphabet Pop" (makes processing easier).
  * <p>
  * <b>introBubble</b> An array of Balls that later contains the bubbles corresponding to each letter in title.
  * <p>
  * <b>gameThread</b> A Thread variable that allows the bubbles to all move at once.
  * <p>
  * <b>box</b> A ContainerBox variable that represents the box in which all the components are contained.
  * <p>
  * <b>t</b> A GameTimer variable that regulates the popping of the bubbles and notifies when to move on to the main menu.
  * <p>
  * <b>currentLetter</b> An integer variable that keeps track of which letter index is to be popped next.
  * <p>
  * <b>bubblePop</b> A Clip variable that refers to the bubble-popping audio clip.
