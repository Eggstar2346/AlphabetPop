  /**
   * The class constructor assigns all the values passed in its parameter to the appropriate instance variables.  It 
   * also calculates the user's score, reads in the background image (within a try block) and sets the panel layout.  A
   * JLabel and JButton are added to a JPanel that is added to the bottom of this JPanel. An ActionListener is added 
   * to the JButton and its inner ActionPerformed method is defined.  Within this ActionPerformed method, there are many
   * things taking place.  The input is being checked using an if statement to see if it is too many or too few 
   * characters.  If this is the case, the box is reset and a JOptionPane is used to inform the user.  If the user 
   * input is acceptable, the scores are saved to a file.  The scores in the file are read in and the user's score
   * is compared to these scores using an if statement.  If the user's score is greater than one of the scores, the 
   * other scores are shifted and the new score is saved in its place.  Try blocks are used to catch IOException and 
   * NumberFormatException, related to reading in from the file.  Lastly, if the user has just played level 3, they are
   * taken to the menu.  Otherwise, the components are removed from the JFrame in the Main class, and a LevelAdvance is
   * constructed and added to the JFrame.
